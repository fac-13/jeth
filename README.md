Show the user an error for any server-side errors that could occur.
Design a mobile-first webpage


### HOW

**Day 1**

1. Created skeleton code
2. Commented sections to help avoid merger conflicts and to keep code organised.
3. created a filter function to get the required data.
4. created server, routed the url to the specific handler.
5. Began some error handling for the back end request.


**Day 2**

1. We made the api request from the front end to back end to the api sever and back to display onto the page.

2. Continued error handiling for backend and worked on front end error handling.

3. Ironed out bug.
